The goal of this assignment is to teach you version control system GIT using various
tutorials available on gitimmersion.com. The site defines total	of 52 different GIT	
tutorials ranging from creation	of repository to traditional version control use of checkin,
 checkout, branching and merging. It also has many advanced tutorials. You are
required to go through each of the tutorial and	understand its usage. Since there is no	
simple way of verifying	your work, on Feb 4th I	will give a quiz on GIT	in this	class. Score	
will determine truth behind	your completion of work and understanding of GIT version	
control	system.
